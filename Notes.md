This page is not intended to be shown on the website. It is intended to act as a readme for ideas of the structure of the website and the content that will go on each page.


-- What is kendo? --
--------------------
A very brief into/history to what kendo is. Maybe put some photos in of us p


-- Membership --
----------------
Info on how much membership costs, notes about asking members to register with BKA after a few months or once they go into bogu?
Could link to the YUSU page where people buy membership


-- Practice Times --
--------------------
Practice time information goes here. I.e. times and locations of the practices. Also link to york city club site.

-- News -- 
----------
Structure this like the blog page on my site. Each blog item can be a piece of news e.g. muiz and gabby passing their grading, uni taikai, etc

-- Contact --
-------------
This will be a page for contacting us. Putting a contact form on here is a better idea than listing the email address.
