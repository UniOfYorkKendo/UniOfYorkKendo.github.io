This weekend we held a kendo taster session joint with some students from York St John University. The session was run joint with Ed Van Der Molen from the [York City Kendo Club](https://www.facebook.com/YorkKendoClub/?locale=en_GB), and involved demonstrations of various aspects of Kendo, as well as the chance to try kendo footwork and hitting!

The session was great fun, and we took a photo to celebrate afterwards!
