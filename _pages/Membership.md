Usually we run several taster sessions at the start of the academic year to allow you to experience kendo for free! If you would like to join outside of this window then please get in touch with us.
Club members are required to buy membership through YUSU, either termly or annually. You can buy membership [here](Https://yusu.org/shop?activity_id=237).

In addition, club members will also have to buy a York Sport Union Black Tier membership for Â£20 per year. More information can be found [here](https://yusu.org/student-life/sport).
